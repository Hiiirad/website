This is the very last week to [submit your talk proposal for KubeCon NA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/cfp/)! We're happy to help brainstorm, review, or copyedit any Linkerd-related talks. DM Jason Morgan or Catherine Paganini on [Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io/) if interested.
